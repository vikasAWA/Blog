The core concept is \"Dialog Engineering,\" a method of collaborative coding between humans and AI, facilitated by the solveit platform.

      "fast.ai's original mission was to democratize AI, primarily through teaching people how to train their own models. Their courses have been instrumental in creating many leading AI practitioners. However, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT has changed the landscape, making AI more accessible without in-depth knowledge of model training. The new \"How to Solve It with Code\" course represents a shift in focus, emphasizing how to effectively use AI tools to solve problems collaboratively. This course aims to teach individuals how to leverage AI in a way that complements human skills, resulting in solutions that are superior to what either could achieve alone. The focus is on empowering individuals with the ability to adapt and extend AI-generated code, ensuring they retain control and understanding of the final product.\n",

      "The solveit platform is a key component of fast.ai's new approach. It is specifically designed to facilitate \"Dialog Engineering,\" a method where humans and AI work together in small, iterative steps to develop code. The platform embeds AI directly into the development process, allowing users to write a line or two of code and then receive suggestions from the AI for the next step. This collaborative environment promotes a powerful feedback loop, enhancing the learning process for both the human and the AI. The solveit platform is not just theoretical; it has been used internally at Answer.AI, yielding impressive results with a small team. This demonstrates the platform's potential to significantly increase productivity and efficiency by combining human expertise with AI capabilities.\n",

      "Dialog Engineering represents a transformative approach to coding, moving beyond simple AI code generation to a collaborative partnership between humans and AI. Instead of relying on AI to produce large blocks of code, Dialog Engineering emphasizes small, iterative steps, where humans and AI work together to refine and improve the code. This creates a powerful feedback loop, leading to code that is cleaner, more maintainable, and better understood. The blog post also mentions how Dialog Engineering is not limited to just building apps, but can be used in any type of task which involves automation or repetitive coding task. This collaborative approach allows individuals to retain control and understanding of the final product, enabling them to make changes, add features, and fix bugs effectively. This results in a synergy that leverages the strengths of both humans and AI, leading to solutions that are more robust and adaptable.\n",
